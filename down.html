		You choose to go down the stairs to retrieve the key. The steps groan under your weight and as you get closer and closer 
		you can hear a metallic rattle of metal agains metal. As you reach the bottom there is a stark pale woman with tattered bloody clothes chained against the far wall. 
		As soon as she catches sight of you she starts to cry red. Begging you to free her. You find the key just out of the woman's 
		reach lying on the floor. What do you do?
