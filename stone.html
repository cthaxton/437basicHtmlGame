		You place the stone into the hole above the hearth and you feel a burst of wind as
		if the storm had come inside. The fire goes out leaving the room pitch black until you hear the 
		storm outside cease and the sun comes up and illuminates the room. You feel yourself change and the woman
		appears beside you and thanks you. You run out of the house as fast as possible before anything else
		like that happens again. You live happily ever after..... So you think....
